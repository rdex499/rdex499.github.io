    <h2>MAE 4190: Fast Robots - Spring 2026</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Rajarshi, and I’m a senior studying Mechanical Engineering 
        at Cornell University, currently enrolled in MAE 4190. My interests focus on 
        embedded systems, robotics, simulation-based design, and hands-on engineering, 
        with an emphasis on machining, prototyping, and building systems that last. 
        Outside of class, I enjoy cycling, horse riding, playing pool, and working on 
        personal hardware projects driven by curiosity and learning. Feel free to 
        connect with me on LinkedIn or via email.</p>
